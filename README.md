Food Baby is Pebble's first nutrition app. Part-nutritionist, part-digital pet, Food Baby's primary goal is to motivate healthy choices through the raising of a virtual pet. As such, your healthy habits translate to both your well-being and your pet's happiness. Logging your food intake into major food categories "feeds" the pet. The pet provides recommendations for what to eat next to maintain a balanced diet.
