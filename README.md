Food Baby is Pebble’s first nutrition app. Part-nutritionist, part-digital pet, Food Baby’s primary goal is to motivate healthy choices through the raising of a virtual pet. As such, your healthy habits translate to both your well-being and your pet’s happiness. Logging your food intake into major food categories “feeds” the pet. The pet provides feedback during mealtimes and throughout the day (e.g. "Eat more veggies!" and "I am thirsty!") which give advice towards maintaining a healthy diet.
